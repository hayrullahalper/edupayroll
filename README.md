### Fetching Environment Variables

To manage environment variables, you need to fetch them from AWS Secrets Manager. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. **Ensure Prerequisites Are Installed**

    - **AWS CLI**: Install AWS CLI if it is not already installed.
    - **`jq`**: Ensure `jq` is installed.

   **Installing AWS CLI**
    - **macOS**: Use Homebrew:
      ```bash
      brew install awscli
      ```
    - **Windows**: Download and install from the [AWS CLI website](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html).
    - **Linux**: Follow instructions on the [AWS CLI installation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-linux.html).

   **Installing `jq`**
    - **macOS**: Use Homebrew:
      ```bash
      brew install jq
      ```
    - **Windows/Linux**: Follow instructions on the [jq website](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/).

2. **Configure AWS CLI**

   Run the following command and provide your AWS credentials and region:
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```
    - **AWS Access Key ID**
    - **AWS Secret Access Key**
    - **Default region name**: Enter `eu-central-1`
    - **Default output format**: Leave as `json` (default)

3. **Fetch Secrets**

   Use the `fetch-secrets` target in the `Makefile` to fetch and update your environment variables. Run:
   ```bash
   make fetch-secrets
   ```

   This command makes the `fetch_secrets.sh` script executable and runs it, updating the `.env` file with secrets from AWS Secrets Manager.
